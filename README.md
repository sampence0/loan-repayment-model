# Loan Default Model
This project was developed for a final project at Indiana University for ECON-E402 (Computational Methods in Macroeconomics). The model was developed as part of the Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle competition. The objective of the competition was to train a machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not a loan applicant is likely to default. The model uses a variety of features from several different datasets, including applicants' credit history, socioeconomic status, personal background, and current financial situation. 

## Data
The data used in this project is provided by Home Credit Group and can be downloaded from this link: 
  - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data.
  
This link contains several csv files with applicant and bureau information, which are all merged with the main 'application_train' dataset which is used as the final set for training and validation. 

## Usage 
1. Download the data from the Kaggle competition page and place it in the working directory of 'feature_engineering.ipynb' and 'my_functions.py'
2. Install the required packages using pip in the command line. 
3. Run the notebook 'feature_engineering.ipynb' with 'my_functions.py' imported.
